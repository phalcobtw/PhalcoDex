# PhalcoDex

**PhalcoDex** is a modern web-based Pokédex built with **React + React Router**, allowing you to search and view detailed information about any Pokémon using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

### 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Interactive search bar** – Enter a Pokémon name and get redirected to `/pokemon/:pokemonName`.
- 🌐 **Seamless client-side navigation** using React Router without page reloads.
- 📦 **Clean separation of concerns** between the search input and the Pokémon data page.
- ⚠️ **Custom toast notifications** for errors like "Pokémon not found".
- 🎨 **Retro Pokédex-inspired design**, with background images working properly even on deep routes.
